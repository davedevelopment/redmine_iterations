# Redmine Iterations

Simple little module that tries to replicate behaviour described by [37signals](http://37signals.com)' internal [Iterations](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2659-iterations-a-new-internal-app-for-managing-what-we-work-on-next) webapp. 

Redmine_iterations allows users to:

* To suggest ideas, initiatives or features (called iterations)
* Upvote these iterations, or offer to work on them

It's only been tested against [Redmine](http://redmine.org) trunk
